            Hoyas are among my favorite houseplants. They are tons of varieties, are easy to grow, tolerate neglect, and are great for the beginner or experienced houseplant enthusiast alike! Hindu Rope Hoya, or Hoya carnosa, is a unique Hoya with crinkled, tightly packed leaves. You may also hear some people refer to the plant as Krinkle Kurl.

            LIGHT

            These plants need quite a bit of light in order to really do their best. They are really slow growers, so if you are impatient, I would recommend purchasing a large plant to start with! Even in great lighting conditions, they may only grow a few inches a year. For best growth, they need a few hours of sun every day. A few hours of morning sun, or afternoon sun would be preferable. If you live in areas with really strong sun, try and avoid mid-day sun. Also, keeping these plants in full sun all day may cause the foliage to bleach out and turn pale. Partial sun will result in much better leaf color. I have my own plant hanging right under a skylight in my sunroom and it receives some direct sun. Having enough light is also important for flowering, and Hindu Rope Hoya has the characteristic, fragrant Hoya flowers. Aren’t they gorgeous? If you keep your plant in darker conditions, not only will you be disappointed with really slow growth (they are already slow growing to begin with, even in great light!) but they will also likely never flower.

            WATERING and FERTILIZER

            Watering is an important aspect of growing Hoyas. Always water thoroughly and moisten all of the soil, let excess water drain out, and don’t allow your plant to sit in water. Keeping plants wet for long periods of time will encourage root rot in Hoyas, so be sure to allow your soil to go completely dry in between watering. Hoyas are epiphytic plants, meaning that they grow on other plants (such as on tree trunks or branches), so they go through periods of being completely soaked, but then dry out quickly in between. Keeping this in mind is important to understand their care! If you are away from home a lot or travel a lot for weeks at a time, Hoyas are ideal! They can easily go 2-3 weeks without any sign of stress in most cases. As far as fertilizing, refrain from using fertilizer in the winter when growth has stopped or is very slow, but I do fertilize my Hoyas the rest of the year. My favorite all-purpose houseplant fertilizer that I use is called Dyna-Gro Grow. It is simply amazing stuff. It is urea-free so you won’t burn your plants if you use it per the instructions on the label. It is also a premium fertilizer that has all the macro and micro nutrients that plants need for growth. I’ve achieved great results and you can too with a consistent regiment! I can’t recommend Dyna-Gro Grow enough. I use it for all my houseplants except succulents.
            
            SOIL
            
            Hoyas like an airy soil that dries out quickly. I would recommend using two parts of your favorite potting soil (I like Miracle Gro or Espoma potting mixes) to which you would add 1 part of an amendment. You can easily find everything on Amazon. To the two parts of soil, mix in one part of perlite, pumice or even orchid bark. Depending on what I have handy, I may change what I use. The important part though is that you want excellent drainage.

            TEMPERATURE and HUMIDITY

            Hindu Rope Hoyas prefer minimum temperatures of at least 60F and above, with warmer daytime temperatures. Most hoyas grow in warm and humid tropical regions. (There are some that grow in higher elevations like Hoya linearis, but the majority of Hoyas like it warmer). Like any epiphyte, Hoyas like high humidity and the plants actually absorb moisture from the air. That being said, they are tolerant of average indoor humidity, but if you can increase humidity, it is absolutely helpful! Be sure to check out my blog post on the best ways to increase humidity for your houseplants. Some of the information may surprise you! I also talk about the most effective method to increase humidity.

            PESTS
            
            Because of the crinkly leaves, dealing with pests can be tricky with these plants. Just take a look at the places they can hide!
            Hindu rope Hoyas are very prone to mealy bugs and it can be tricky to detect them at first because they have so many places to hide in the contorted leaves. As soon as you detect them, start a spraying regimen. I would recommend using Neem Oil or Insecticidal soap on a weekly basis. In the middle of each week in between spraying, be sure to rinse the plant off to remove any residue so that it doesn’t harm the plant. Keep repeating weekly even after you don’t see any mealy bugs anymore. This will ensure that they are gone. You’ll want to treat your plant not only for the sake of your Hoya, but also so the mealy bugs don’t spread to your other houseplants. Pests can quickly go out of control when left unchecked! You can easily purchase Neem Oil or Insecticidal Soap easily on Amazon and I always have one of them handy so I can use when needed. These are both safe and naturally derived products, but please be sure to use it according to the label.

            PROPAGATION

            Propagation is simple. Simply take a cutting that has 3 or 4 leaves. Take the bottom leaf off, and place it right into a small pot of soil. If you want a fuller plant, place multiple cuttings in the same pot. It helps to keep the soil relatively moist as rooting is occurring. Keeping them in a warm area and increasing humidity will also speed the process up. You may want to consider placing your rooting cuttings in a clear plastic bag to keep the humidity high until your cuttings are rooted.

            HOYA TOXICITY

            Hindu rope plant is non-toxic to cats and dogs according to the ASPCA.

          care: """
        Epipremnum aureum is the finest houseplant for growers who struggle to keep their plants alive. This plant thrives well in every kind of condition. It grows even in areas with no sunlight, which makes it great for shaded or dark corners. Epipremnum aureum is great for offices as it nurtures in fluorescent lighting.

        Epipremnum aureum is even the first choice of various people as it requires no regular watering. So, people who forget to water their houseplants regularly can go for this one. The best part about this plant is that it holds the ability to purify the surrounding air. So, there is no reason whatsoever why you do need an Epipremnum aureum. So, let’s know more things in detail about this incredible plant!

        Generally, this plant is most commonly known as “Devil’s Ivy” as it continues to grow and become invasive even in circumstances that are not ordinarily good for houseplants. This houseplant is even referred to as the Golden Pothos. It belongs to the “Araceae” family.

        GROWING HABIT

        According to the Missouri Botanical Garden, when this plant grows in the wild, it reaches about 40 feet. This plant even grows up tree trunks. As a houseplant, you can stretch it across the wall or over a trellis kept in the container’s center.

        WATER AND LIGHT NEEDS

        This plant is often suggested to beginners due to its ability to thrive in several conditions. It tolerates various light conditions. It grows well in well-lit rooms as well as rooms with no natural light. However, these plants prefer indirect light.

        In terms of water needs, they need not much water. These plants can even tolerate drought but too much dryness can stunt their growth.

        GROWING IN SOIL AND WATER

        One can grow this golden pothos in both soil and water. For growing these plants, just put them in a jar full of water or grow them in potting mix or soil. It depends on cutting or seedling. If you are using a part of the soil-grown plant, grow it in the same way. If a part of the water-rooted plant, follow the same method. The plant will take around 4 weeks to root.

    Plant(name: "Cactus", image: "cactus", gradientColors: [Color.clear, Color("ColorCactus").opacity(0.8)], description: "There are two large groups of cacti grown as houseplants; both are popular and familiar, and both can thrive indoors with relatively little maintenance.", plantProfile: ["", ""], care: """
            In its natural habitat, the orchid cactus grows on tree branches. So, its root system is delicate and needs air to thrive. And because regular soil is heavy and dense, it could suffocate your plant’s roots. As such, the best potting mix to use for your orchid cactus is a light, humus-rich, and porous potting soil that drains quickly but holds some moisture. The soil needs to be coarse and not finely sifted. Moreover, it should also be slightly acidic. You can use a regular potting mix with a bit of sand and peat. Sand with salt, like the one you get from the beach, is not recommended. You also need to make sure that you are using clean sand. You can also mix one part peat moss-based potting mix with one part perlite. This mixture would allow faster water drainage of water. For aeration and purification purposes, you can also add generous amounts of charcoal that are crushed into small bits.

            WATERING

            The orchid cactus can be a little fussy when it comes to its water. It is important to keep the soil moist at all times during its growth period from spring throughout the fall. You will have to water it sparingly in the winter while also not allowing the soil to dry out completely. This is because the plant rests in the winter, and it will need just enough water for its stems not to wither. You will know when you have kept the soil too dry because the stems will go shriveled and limp. Meanwhile, overwatering the plant will lead the roots and the stems to rot. If you see the first signs of rotting, immediately cut off the damaged stems. Other than rotting, too much water can also lead to fungus growth, and it invites gnats and other pests. You may want to use a soil moisture meter so you could monitor your plant’s water needs. If the meter says that the soil is dry, you can give your orchid cactus a thorough watering. It’s also a good idea to mist or spray your plant’s stems, except when it is in bud or is flowering. Doing this humidifies and cleans the stems of settled dust.

            POTTING and REPOTTING

            The orchid cactus performs best when it is not over potted, and it is root-bound, which is when its roots fill up its pot and consume all growing space. This would explain why an orchid cactus in a five-inch (13-centimeter) pot would flower a lot quicker compared to the one that’s planted in a 10-inch (25-centimeter) pot. It is recommended that you repot your orchid cactus every seven years. Others also advise that you should do it not more often than every two years when a mature plant calls to be repotted. You should also transfer your orchid cactus to a pot that is only slightly larger than the current one.

            HOW TO REPOT THE ORCHID CACTUS

            First, take the plant out of the container, clean the soil off its roots, and place it in a larger pot with a drainage hole on the bottom and filled with a fresh batch of well-draining potting mix. Then wait for about three days to a week before you water the newly repotted orchid cactus. Do not repot your orchid cactus when it is in bloom because this can cause pot-shock. Pot shock is what you call the condition when the plant’s root system could not adjust to change, causing its buds and flowers to drop. You should wait a month after your orchid cactus blooms before you transplant it. However, people are discouraged from transplanting unless it is truly necessary.
            
            SUN AND LIGHTING REQUIREMENT

            This plant likes to have bright light, but it does not do well being exposed to direct sunlight, unlike most other cacti. On the other hand, insufficient light will cause spindly growth and, during flowering seasons, it will have only a few blooms. Exposure to too much sun will burn the plant’s stems, turning them red. As such, place your orchid cactus in a location with filtered light. It is best to place it somewhere where the plant can get full morning sun but does not get exposed to direct sunlight during high noon and in the afternoon.

            THE IDEAL TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY LEVELS
       
            The orchid cactus needs moderate indoor humidity levels of about 40 percent to 50 percent. For extra dry homes, you can raise the humidity in the room by using a cool-mist humidifier. But if you just need to boost humidity a little bit for your plant, you can place a dish of wet pebbles underneath its pot. During the winter, our homes tend to be very dry. You can spray your orchid cactus with a mist of water in case the humidity level dips too low. Remember that very depleted conditions can contribute to problems that pertain to the roots, especially if the soil is not well-drained. Additionally, without adequate levels of humidity, the plant’s buds may drop. In terms of the ideal temperatures for the orchid cactus, the average room temperature of 65° to 75°F (18° to 24°C) is good. However, if you want to promote flowering, give the plant eight to 10 weeks of cold days of 60° to 65°F (16°to 18°C) days and 45° to 55°F (7° to 13°C) nights during winter.

          care: """
            The Moonshine Snake plant is kind of like a celebrity indoor plant amongst many households. Sansevierias are sturdy cultivars with immensely-low maintenance demands, so be sure that your experience with this houseplant would be incredibly exciting.

            Its botanical name is Sansevieria trifasciata, and the succulent belongs to the Asparagaceae family. It’s native to West Africa, particularly from Nigeria, Senegal, Ghana, and Guinea.
            
            Taking care of the snake plant just requires minimal effort, so it’s perfect for beginners looking to adopt an impressively tolerant succulent. You can place it on a windowsill since the plant only grows up 2′ feet tall unless you want to use growth hormones and add fertilizer during spring and summer.

            SOIL REQUIREMENTS

            Use the typical potting mix for succulents when planting your moonshine snake to help the rhizomes have a firm support base. Potting soil for cacti plants would also be ideal in this scenario. It makes the drainage process a whole lot easier, compared to loamy soil which is less permeable. Take note that if the roots are stuck in water for extremely long hours, they would begin to rot and you’d lose your plant eventually. You definitely have the autonomy to transplant your Moonshine plant anytime you deem fit, but it’s best to be a little patient so the rooting hormones and the rhizome structure can both have a grace period to mutate to any acute conditions that’ll probably occur when repotting it.

            WATERING

            One thing to take note is this succulent doesn’t need too much water to keep its leaves fairly strong and healthy. It’s naturally a hardy plant and stores enough water to beat dry periods. If the soil takes longer hours to drain water, the roots might begin to rot. Notwithstanding the fact that the Moonshine snake is significantly drought-resistant, you still need to give the soil some period to dry up entirely before the next watering session. You also want to tone down the watering frequency during winter since the rooting hormones become numb due to the extremely cold conditions. So the nutrient-intake and water absorption would come to a halt and the roots get ruined if they’re drenched in water for too long. If you want to accelerate the growth rate and foliage quality of your plant, you can purchase an all-purpose soluble fertilizer, but use not more than once every summer or spring, when the growing conditions are far more suitable.

            GROOMING & MAINTENANCE
            
            It’s quite impressive how the snake plant thrives with minimal grooming efforts. But that’s not to mean you have the optimal leverage to deprive off of your plant the attention it deserves. After all, you don’t want to end up with a plain-looking houseplant somewhere in your apartment’s balcony. To maintain it’s exotic and elegant appearance, you’ll mostly need to pluck off the dead leaves, keep the medium in a spot where it gets moderate to beaming light. If the leaves begin to turn yellow, then your plant could be suffering from root rot.

            LIGHT & TEMPERATURE

            Ideally, the moonshine snake adopts a striking look when grown under filtered bright light—mostly the morning sun if you’re looking to grow it indoors. But you don’t need to rigidly stick to this tweak since it can still mutate to both high and low light conditions. With USDA hardiness zones 10 through 11, this suggests that the secret sauce to help your plant thrive consistently is to grow it under warmer temperatures—preferably between 55-8°C.

It has beautiful large green leaves that feature slits and fenestrations.", plantProfile: ["", ""],
          care: """
            If intended as a houseplant, choose a deep pot with many drainage holes. Fill the bottom third with peaty potting soil and establish a stake gently for the stem to climb on. Set the roots into the container. Fill with soil around the roots. Firmly surround the stake with soil and use plant ties to attach the stem to the stake. Every two years or so, the Monstera deliciosa will likely outgrow its pot. Transplant into a pot a few inches wider and deeper.

            LIGHT

            This evergreen prefers bright, indirect sunlight in temperatures that remain consistently between 65 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit. Too much direct light in warmer months may burn the foliage. Still, set indoor plants outside at least once a year in direct sunlight to encourage lush growth.

            Outdoors, the Monstera deliciosa can grow in the full shade of deep woodlands and semi-shade of light woodlands.

            SOIL

            When established in a container, it requires peat-based potting media. Outdoors, it is suitable for light sandy, medium loamy, and heavy clay soils with acid or neutral pH. Even so, it thrives most in well-drained, moderately moist soil.

            WATER

            Give the plant regular waterings during the growing season. The soil will need to dry out slightly in between. Water only occasionally in fall and winter. To increase humidity indoors, mist the foliage using a spray bottle of demineralized water or rainwater.

            FERTILIZER

            If needed or desired, use a balanced liquid fertilizer every few weeks during the growing season for indoor plants.

            PESTS

            Wiping dust or debris with a damp sponge or paper towel will keep the plant clean and avoidant of pests. Common pests include mealybugs, aphids, thrips, scale and spider mites. If any are found on the foliage, spray the plant with a direct water stream. Leaves can also be washed with insecticidal soap.

            PRUNING

            Trim aerial roots if they get too unruly for the space, though tucking them back into the pot is preferred. Unlike some other houseplants, their roots do not damage surfaces.

            PROPAGATION

            Stems and leaves respond well to trimming. Cuttings can be used to start new plants. However the most popular method of propagating M. deliciosa is air-layering, for which you'll need sharp and clean pruning shears, floral or sphagnum moss, a plastic bag, and twist ties.

            First, find a leaf that is growing out of a stem and has a short aerial root below it. Cut a small notch about one third of the stem's width, just below that root. Wrap where the leaf joins the stem in a one-inch layer of sphagnum moss. Spray the moss with water to increase moisture and wrap it in plastic. Use twist ties to secure it. Ensure the moss remains moist until roots develop. Finally, cut the stem and establish the young plant in soil.

            ADDITIONAL OUTDOOR CARE TIPS

            As the Monstera Deliciosa is hardy in USDA zones 10 through 12, it will thrive year-round in warm, humid weather. When planting outdoors, establish in part-shade in well-draining soil. If the soil is naturally salty in your region, move it to the patio or indoors. Apply a balanced fertilizer three or four times a year and the plant may grow 10 feet tall or more.

            TOXICITY

            Ripe fruits are edible but according to the North Caroline State University Extension Services, fruits may cause some people allergies. Consuming the leaves and other parts of the plant may cause severe mouth burning, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Minor skin irritation from just handling the plant, is possible, though quite rare, making the Monstera deliciosa a beloved, versatile houseplant in many parts of the world.

            The ASPCA cautions that this plant is toxic to cats and dogs. If these furry friends live in your home, consider an animal-friendly houseplant instead.

            All varieties of the snake plant (genus sansevieria) are succulents that grow well indoors as houseplants. Also known as viper’s bowstring hemp, or mother in law’s tongue, sansevieria varieties are excellent houseplants that suit your home decor. Some snake plant varieties have a long sword-shaped flat green leaves. Other tropical sansevieria varieties such as sansevieria cylindrica (African spear plant), and starfish sansevieria have cylindrical round leaves with pointed ends. There are even snake plant varieties such as Sansevieria Trifasciata ‘Black Gold’ that can be used as air filtering house plants. To care for sansevieria varieties (snake plants) grow the plants in well-draining potting soil and water them when the soil is dry. In winter, only water your snake plants (sansevieria) occasionally. Snake plants grow well indoors at normal room temperature. Fertilize sansevierias once a month in spring and summer. To help the snake plant grow well indoors use a pot with a drainage hole in the bottom.

            One of the reasons to grow sansevierias indoors is that they grow well in poor conditions. These succulents requires little maintenance and can provide attractive green and yellow colors to your home décor. There are about 70 species of Sansevieria. Theses are flowering plants in the genus Sansevieria and in the plant family Asparagaceae. Sansevieria varieties are colloquially known as ‘snake plants’ because of their long leaves and tapered ends. Depending on the variety, other types of sansevieria plants have other common names. For example, the Sansevieria trifasciata is commonly named ‘mother-in-law’s tongue.’ Its name comes from the fact that the plant leaves are long and sharp. This sansevieria variety is also called ‘viper’s bowstring hemp’ because its fibers are strong enough to make bowstrings.

            One of the main benefits of growing a snake plant (sansevieria) indoors is its ability to filter certain toxins from the air. The advantage of growing Sansevieria laurentii (Mother in Law’s Tongue) is that it reduces the levels of the toxins Trichloroethylene (TCE), Benzene, and Formaldehyde. This benefit was reported in a study conducted by NASA.

            One of the tallest varieties of sansevieria trifasciata is the ‘Laurentii’ cultivar. This snake plant has tall elegant variegated yellow and green leaves. The grayish-green leaves have stripy patterns along their length. The yellow band running the length of the ‘snake’ leaves gives style and elegance to this sansevieria variety. Expect this striped snake plant to grow to between 2 and 4 ft. (60 – 120 cm) tall. This robust type of leafy plant grows well in most conditions. Due to its tall-growing nature, it is a good type of tropical houseplant to place in corners where some height is needed.

          care: """
            Philodendron ‘Brasil’ tolerates low light but prefers bright, indirect illumination. Its well-draining soil should dry halfway before watering. The plant likes warm room temperatures year-round, can handle normal humidity, and is hardy against pests and disease. Fertilize regularly during the growing season. East- and west-facing windows are generally excellent locations to provide good Philodendron Brasil care. They also do well in the strong light of a southern exposure if placed a few feet away. Artificial illumination is another good option. If you want to put them in a north-facing window or another spot without much ambient light – for example, the center of a room – artificial light can make up the difference.

            WATERING

            Philodendron Brasil isn’t fussy about watering; though, like most plants, they hate being overwatered. They aren’t as susceptible to root rot as many tropicals, but they aren’t invulnerable. Even if they don’t succumb to root rot outright, soil that stays too wet can slow their growth and cause smaller leaves. The plant’s soil can become fairly dry without protest, but it doesn’t like drought. Let the soil dry out about halfway before watering – the top two inches at a minimum. Use your finger to check; don’t depend on a schedule. The following are signs to watch for. Overwatering and underwatering can show similar symptoms, so check the roots and soil if you aren’t sure. Yellow leaves usually means overwatering … but chronic drought also stresses leaves. Foliage with brown edges usually means underwatering. Leaves that turn completely brown can mean root rot from overwatering. Wilting is caused by a lack of internal pressure: Underwatered foliage wilts from lack of water; overwatering can rot the roots and starve the leaves.

            SOIL

            The Philodendron Brasil is a hemiepiphyte that can live part of its life in a tree canopy. It doesn’t need traditional soil. Because of this, the plant does best in a loose and well-draining mix with good water retention. Soilless mixes of sphagnum peat moss or coco coir work well. Adding 50% perlite to a regular potting mix can be effective, too, but avoid excessive organic amendments as these can decompose and become compacted.

            HUMIDITY

            Another reason the Philodendron Brasil is such an exceptional low-maintenance plant is its tolerance of dry air indoors. Like most tropicals, however, they do appreciate higher humidity. They tend to grow faster and produce larger leaves with more moisture in the air. Indoor heating in wintertime can cause issues: if the plant looks lackluster and its leaves are developing brown edges, consider grouping it with other plants, placing humidity trays nearby.

            Fiddle-leaf figs are perfect as focal points of a room if you can situate them in a floor-standing container where the plant is allowed to grow to at least 6 feet. They’re fairly fast growers and can be potted at any point in the year if you're like most gardeners acquiring a nursery plant to keep indoors.

            Fiddle-leaf figs are not especially demanding plants as long as you can get their growing conditions right. When grown as a houseplant, be prepared to rotate your fiddle-leaf fig every few days so a different part faces the light source. That way, it will grow evenly, rather than lean toward the light. Also, every week or two dust the leaves with a damp cloth. Not only does this make the leaves appear shinier and more appealing, but it also allows more sunlight to hit the leaves for photosynthesis. Moreover, you can trim off any damaged or dead leaves as they arise, as they no longer benefit the plant. And if you wish, you can prune off the top of the main stem for a bushier growth habit.

            LIGHT

            Fiddle-leaf figs require bright, filtered light to grow and look their best. Direct sunlight can burn the leaves, especially exposure to hot afternoon sun. And plants that are kept in very low light conditions will fail to grow rapidly.

            SOIL

            Any quality indoor plant potting mix should be suitable for a fiddle-leaf fig. Ensure that the soil drains well.

            WATER

            Fiddle-leaf figs like a moderate amount of moisture in the soil. If the plant doesn’t get enough water, its leaves will wilt and lose their bright green color. And if it gets too much water, the plant might drop its leaves and suffer from root rot, which ultimately can kill it. During the growing season (spring to fall), water your fiddle-leaf fig when the top inch of soil feels dry. And over the winter months, water slightly less. Furthermore, these plants are sensitive to high salt levels in the soil. So it's ideal to flush the soil until water comes out the bottom of the pot at least monthly. This helps to prevent salt build-up.

            FERTILIZER

            Fertilize throughout the growing season with a high-nitrogen plant food, following label instructions. There are fertilizers specially made for fiddle-leaf figs available. You generally won’t have to feed your plant over the winter.

            The Pilea peperomioides is a popular houseplant thanks to its attractive coin-shaped foliage and ease of care. This flowering perennial in the nettle family (Urticaceae) is native to southern China, growing naturally along the base of the Himalayan mountains. The Pilea peperomioides has many different common names and may also be referred to as the Chinese money plant, coin plant, pancake plant, and UFO plant.

            LIGHT

            The Pilea peperomioides thrives in medium to bright indirect light. Rotate your plant regularly to keep it looking symmetrical. Avoid locations that receive harsh, direct light as it will burn the delicate leaves.

            While this plant can adapt to lower light conditions; it will become leggy, grow fewer offshoots, and the coin-shaped leaves may become smaller. Overall, this plant is healthiest and most attractive when grown in bright light conditions.

            SOIL

            Plant your Pilea peperomioides in rich, well-draining soil. A high-quality organic potting mix that is peat-based or coir-based is best. Amend the soil with perlite to increase the drainage and ensure the soil does not become waterlogged. A soil pH between 6.0-7.0 is best for this plant.

            WATER

            This evergreen perennial is considered to have medium water needs. Allow the plant to nearly dry out between waterings and then water well. The leaves of a Pilea peperomioides will begin to droop when it dries out, which is a good indication that it’s time for watering.

            FERTILIZER

            The Pilea peperomioides benefits from monthly fertilization in the spring and summer months. Use a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer for best results. Avoid fertilizing during the fall and winter months when the plant has gone into dormancy.
